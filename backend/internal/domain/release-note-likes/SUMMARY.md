# Release Note Likes

User reactions (likes) on release notes, tracked by anonymous client ID.

The `release-note-likes` package tracks likes on release notes from widget users. Since widget users are anonymous, likes are identified by a `ClientID` (generated client-side and stored in browser local storage).

**Key entity: `ReleaseNoteLike`**
- `ReleaseNoteID` — The liked release note
- `OrganisationID` — Tenant scoping
- `ClientID` — Anonymous client identifier (not a logged-in user)

**Key components:**
- `Service` — Toggle like (create/delete), check like state, count likes
- `Repository` — GORM queries for like operations

**Integrations:**
- References `release-notes.ReleaseNote` and `organisation.Organisation`
- Widget API (`api/widget`) exposes like toggle and state endpoints
- Widget `tasks/release-note-likes.ts` handles client-side API calls
- `ClientID` generated by widget's `lib/clientId.ts`
